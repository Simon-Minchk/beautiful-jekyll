I've always wondered what platforms and genres have dominated the video game industry over time and I finally have some data to work with. It's not a perfect data set, but it's a good baseline to get a general idea. It only has data up to near the end of 2016 and only includes games with sales of over 100,000 copies. This means PC as a platform will probably be under represented with its high amount of less popular indie games and countless free games available to play.

My first question was which genres rose to the top. To start, I made a graph that showed a comparison of genres over the years. I decided to rank them by how many games sold over 100,000 copies since more games in a genre means more than one big game that sells more in my opinion. I cleared out the lower ranked genres to make the graph come out better. We can see that Action games rose to the top in the early 80s where it stayed for a few years until the genres evened out a bit. The genres stayed even until about 1995 where sports took a decent lead for nearly 10 years until it was passed by action games which remained on top for the rest of the data set.

I've always thought action, adventure, and shooter games would be near the top and sure enough action games were on top or close by the entire time. What surprised me was how prevalent sport games were, as they were the top genre for quite some time and remained near the top until they dropped off around 2010 although they still remained quite popular. Shooters weren't nearly as close to the top as I thought they would be, although they were consistently a popular genre nonetheless. Adventure games were surprisingly near the bottom for a while but had great popularity especially from 2006–2010 until resting in the middle of the genres.
Which platforms were most successful over the years.

Once again I made a graph, this time its global sales (in millions) per year by platform. There are significantly more platforms than popular genres so I decided to trim it down to the top 10. The original Playstation had a very big lead late 90s and was then overtaken by its successor the Playstation 2. Next generation showed the release of the Xbox 360 and the third generation of Playstation but nintendo's Wii took the top spot until dying down and getting passed by both.

I was surprised at how long some platforms stayed somewhat relevant, the first Playstation for example lasted for nearly 10 years. I never knew that the Xbox came out after the Playstation 2, it makes sense that the Playstation 2 beat out the originally Xbox since they had already released their first console and had more recognition. Its pretty cool that you can see spikes that sort of show where a new generation starts every 5 years.
