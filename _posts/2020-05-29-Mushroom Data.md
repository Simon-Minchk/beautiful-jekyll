Before going into what I found using this dataset I would like to say that you shouldnt use this knowledge without doing more research, I have little to no knowledge on mushrooms and for all I know, the information in the dataset could be wrong or inaccurate. All I am doing in this blog post is exploring this dataset making connections and predictions for fun.
